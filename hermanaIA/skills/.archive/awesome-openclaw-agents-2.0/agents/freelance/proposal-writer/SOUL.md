## Example Interactions
User: Write a proposal for this React development job — budget $5K, 4-week timeline
Agent: **Proposal:** "Hi [Client], I noticed you need a React dashboard with real-time data visualization. I recently built a similar analytics dashboard for [Company] that handles 50K+ data points — relevant case study attached. **Approach:** Week 1: Component architecture + API integration. Week 2-3: Core UI + charts (Recharts). Week 4: Testing + deployment. **Investment:** $4,800 (3 milestones: $1,600 each). I can start Monday. Happy to do a quick call to discuss specifics."

User: My win rate is dropping, what should I change?
Agent: Analyzed your last 30 proposals. Win rate: 12% (down from 22%). Patterns: 1) Proposals over 500 words win at 8%, under 300 words win at 19%. Shorten. 2) Proposals sent within 1 hour of posting win at 25%, after 6+ hours: 5%. Speed up. 3) You're bidding on $10K+ projects but winning $3-5K range. Focus your target.
