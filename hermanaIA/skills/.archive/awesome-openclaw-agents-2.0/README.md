## Security

OpenClaw agents run on your hardware with access to your files and services. Follow these best practices:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Exposed gateway | Bind to `localhost` only. Use SSH tunneling for remote access. Never expose port 18789 to the internet. |
| API key leaks | Store keys in `.env` files. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`. Rotate keys regularly. |
| Malicious skills | Only install skills from ClawHub verified publishers. Review SKILL.md before installing. |
| Prompt injection | Set strict `## Rules` in SOUL.md. Limit file system access. Disable shell commands for untrusted inputs. |
| Unattended agents | Use HEARTBEAT.md with scope limits. Set budget caps. Enable logging for all actions. |

## 💰 Cost Optimization & Multi-Provider

After Anthropic's April 2026 pricing change, OpenClaw usage on third-party harnesses requires separate pay-as-you-go billing. Here are free and low-cost alternatives:

### One-Command Ollama Setup

```bash
ollama launch openclaw --model gemma4
```

This installs OpenClaw, pulls the model, and starts the gateway. Pick your model:

| Model | Size | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| `gemma4:e2b` | 7.2 GB | Edge devices, minimal RAM |
| `gemma4:e4b` | 9.6 GB | Laptops, fast inference |
| `gemma4:latest` | 9.6 GB | All-rounder, 128K context |
| `gemma4:26b` | 18 GB | Strong reasoning (MoE) |
| `gemma4:31b` | 20 GB | Maximum performance |
| `qwen3` | 20 GB | Best local tool calling |
| `deepseek-v3` | API | $0.27/M tokens |

### Ollama-Ready Configs

Every agent in this repo works with Ollama models. Set your model in SOUL.md:

```yaml
Model: ollama/gemma4
```

Or switch globally:

```bash
openclaw models set ollama/gemma4:e4b
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Cost Comparison

| Provider | Input Cost | Output Cost | Monthly (moderate) |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Claude Sonnet (API) | $3.00/M | $15.00/M | ~$45-90 |
| Claude Haiku (API) | $0.80/M | $4.00/M | ~$12-25 |
| GPT-4o Mini | $0.15/M | $0.60/M | ~$5-10 |
| DeepSeek V3 | $0.27/M | $1.10/M | ~$4-8 |
| Ollama Cloud | Subscription | Subscription | ~$10-20 |
| Ollama Local | Free | Free | $0 |
